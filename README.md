### Hi y'all, I'm Kari! 👋

- 🏫 I'm currently in my third-year studying Computer Science, Economics, and Spanish at **Vanderbilt University**
- 👩‍🏫 I use SwiftUI, Firebase, XCTest, Python, and C in my current coursework.
- 💻 I love working with SwiftUI, React, React Native, Figma, and MongoDB in projects – both personal and for others!
- 📋 On campus, I am involved with: **VandyHacks** (Former President, currently focused on Marketing and Mentorship), **Vanderbilt: Women in Computing** (Scholarship Lead for Grace Hopper 2023) and **Studio V** (Treasurer – leading Finances for Women)
- 🛫 Off campus, I am a Coach and Streamer for **Major League Hacking** – supporting hackathons worldwide, teaching concepts I am passionate about, and creating an inviting technologist community. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about **Entrepreneurship and the Start-Up Space, Cross-Platform Development,** and **Accessibility in Tech**
- 💬 Let's chat about my professional interests in **Mobile Development**, **Hackathons**, **Diversity & Inclusion**, **Mentorship**
