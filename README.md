### Hi y'all, I'm Kari! 👋

- 🏫 I'm currently in my third year studying Computer Science, Economics, and Spanish at **Vanderbilt University**
- 👩‍🏫 I use SwiftUI, Firebase, XCTest, Python, and C in my current coursework.
- 💻 I love working with SwiftUI, React, React Native, Figma, and MongoDB in projects – both personal and for others!
- 📋 On campus, I am involved with: VandyHacks (Former President, currently focused on Marketing and Mentorship), Vanderbilt: Women in Computing (Scholarship Lead for Grace Hopper 2023) and Studio V (Treasurer – leading finances for Womens' workout group)
- 🛫 Off campus, I am a Coach and Streamer for Major League Hacking (MLH) – supporting hackathons worldwide, teaching concepts I am passionate about, and creating an inviting technologist community. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about entrepreneurship and the start-up space, cross-platform development,** and accessibility in tech
- 💬 Let's chat about my professional interests in mobile development, hackathons, diversity & inclusion, or mentorship
