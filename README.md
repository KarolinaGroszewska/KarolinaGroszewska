- Hi! My name is Kari and I am a junior at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, studying Computer Science and Economics. 
- I am an undergraduate Teaching Assistant, President of VandyHacks, and Co-VP at Women in Computing. My passions include increasing the diversity of individuals in technology through making tech ventures easily accessible and engaging, expanding opportunities for individuals of all skill levels looking to get involved in tech, and creating cool web and mobile applications. Every product I work on aims to improve ease of life!
- I spent Summer of 2022 as an application development intern at Vanguard, where I worked on full-stack applications in Java and Angular for Personal Advisor Services. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to hear more!
- Current or recent personal projects include:
    - Atendi: an automated attendance tracker for iOS and Android 
    - Baby Bear Summer Camp: a strategy resource builder made as a part of Vanderbilt: Programmers of Games 
    - Soba: a tool meant to provide insights into available housing options at Vanderbilt University and second-place winner at UAInnovate!
    - SpotifyMatched: Vanguard 2022 Intern Project in React and Flask matching users based on music tastes
- Outside of the dev world, I enjoy playing board games, trying new gluten-free foods, and drinking fancy coffee.
